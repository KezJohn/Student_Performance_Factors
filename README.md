This analysis provides a comprehensive look into the factors affecting student performance and offers actionable insights for educators, parents, and policymakers. By examining variables like sleep hours, physical activity, attendance, teacher quality, and school type, we uncovered key trends that can drive improvements in educational outcomes. For instance, it was evident that students sleeping less than six hours performed poorly, achieving only up to a 'C' grade, highlighting the critical role of adequate rest in academic success. Teacher quality emerged as a significant determinant, with high-quality teaching consistently leading to better exam scores. Additionally, the study compared public and private schools, revealing differences in performance levels tied to institutional support. Physical activity was also analyzed, showing how it correlates with attendance, sleep, and academic achievement. This analysis equips stakeholders with data-driven insights to implement targeted interventions, promoting better learning environments and fostering student well-being and success.
